# Linearity

**Quantum mechanics is linear, while classic mechanics can be non-linear.**

QM has the property of **linearity**, similarly to Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism.

Linearity implies that if we have a solution, for example for Maxwell's equations which is:

```math
(E, B, p, J)
```

Then we can multiply by a real valued constant $A E R$, to get

aE, aB, ap, aJ

Which will also be a solution

This is how a translantic cable can pass millions of simulatneous data streams, without them interferring with each other.

Linearilty also implies that if we have two solutions:

E1, B1, p1, J1 & E2, B2, p2, J2

Then the `sum` of the two solutions is also a solution:

E1 + E2, B1 + B2, p1 + p1, J1 + J1

We can add two solutions, or a single one we can scale by a number.

Linear equation

L u = 0
L is a linear operator
u is an unknown

L(au) = a Lu      where a is a real number

and 

L (u1 + u2) = Lu1 + Lu2
