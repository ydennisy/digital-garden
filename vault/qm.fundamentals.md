# Fundamental Concepts

- **Born Rule**: a basic mathematical feature of quantum mechanics is that a probability is found by taking the square of the absolute value of a complex number, known as a probability amplitude.
- **Wave Function**: a quantum particle like an electron can be described by a wave function, which associates to each point in space a probability amplitude.
