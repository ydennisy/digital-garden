# Digital Garden

**Welcome to the digital garden of Dennis Yurkevich.**

> The phrase "digital garden" is a metaphor for thinking about writing and creating that focuses less on the resulting "showpiece" and more on the process, care, and craft it takes to get there. -- [Joel Hooks](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden)
